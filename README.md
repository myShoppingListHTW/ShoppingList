## Overview

The Shopping List App is a powerful and user-friendly checklist application designed to streamline your shopping experience.
It simplifies the process of creating, managing, and sharing your shopping lists.
No more forgetting items or feeling overwhelmed at the store – our app has got you covered!

## Very Important:
##### We regret to inform you that due to unforeseen technical challenges, we were unable to configure the self-registration feature in our app as originally planned. As a result, we have taken the initiative to add your official university email addresses to our Okta system.

##### Here's what you need to know:

* You will receive an activation email from Okta to your official university email address.


* Once your Okta account is activated, you will be able to log in to our app using your credentials.
  We understand that this may cause some inconvenience, and we sincerely apologize for any disruption this may cause to your experience. Our team is here to assist you throughout the process, and we are committed to ensuring a smooth transition.

##### If you encounter any confusion, problems, or have questions during the account activation process, please do not hesitate to contact us. We will be readily available to provide any assistance you may require.

Thank you for your understanding, and we appreciate your patience as we work to resolve this matter. We look forward to providing you with an excellent user experience on our app.
